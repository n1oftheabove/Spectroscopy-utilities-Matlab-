# Spectroscopy utilites for Matlab

You'll find here various Matlab scripts I created in 2012 and 2013 to acquire and evaluate spectroscopic data in the group **Ultrafast Dynamics of Condensed Matter** at Universit√§t Potsdam during my Master thesis research on structural and electronic dynamics in superlattices, making use of all optical Pump Probe spectroscopy.

Feel free to use the code as you like, credit to my github ***n1oftheabove*** is appreciated
